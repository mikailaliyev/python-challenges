# Using the BookInfo database, ask the user for an authorâ€™s name 
# and then save all the books by that author to a text file, 
# with each field separated by dashes so it looks as follows:
#
# 5 - Murder of the Orient Express - Agatha Christie - 1934
# 8 - The murder of the links - Agatha Christie - 1923
# 10 - The secret adversary - Agatha Christie - 1921
# 11 - The seven dials mistery - Agatha Christie - 1929
#
# Open the text file to make sure it has worked correctly.
